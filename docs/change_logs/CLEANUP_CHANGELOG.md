# Documentation Cleanup Log

This log records documentation organization and cleanup actions.

## Current Layout
- The root README is `README.md` for the repository homepage.
- All other Markdown documentation lives under `docs/`.

## Cleanup Notes
- Removed raw strict matcher export files from `docs/strict_matcher/` to keep docs focused on maintainable design and implementation notes.
- Updated the documentation index and overview files to reflect the current layout.
